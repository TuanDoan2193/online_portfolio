        <h3>BIO</h3>
        <p>I am Tuan Doan, 25 years old, born in Vietnam, studying in Finland.</p>
        <p>My major is Information Technology. Although I experienced various competence tracks in the university, I favor front-end
          developing the most at this moment. I also like Java as a back-end programming language. My next target is to become
          a full-stack developer.</p>
        <p> Moreover, I have strong education background in the field of Business Management. I started with getting a bachelor
          degree in Vietnam. In Finland, I joined various projects, events and courses related to business management and
          entrepreneurship.
